### :bulb: What I learned

A cool thing that I learned was to use **em** and ```css overflow: hidden``` to properly set a border-radius to a div. Also I got to learn a bit more about ```position: relative``` and ```position: absolute```, and to name classes using BEM method.

### :bookmark: Continued development

I want to learn more about units such as vh, vw, em, positions (absolute and relative), and how to have items properly aligned in every screen resolution.
